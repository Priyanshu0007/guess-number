## Description

Create an engaging number guessing website using the powerful trio of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Craft an intuitive user interface in HTML, featuring input fields for number guesses, a submit button, and a dynamic display to provide feedback. Employ CSS to style the interface, making it visually appealing and responsive. JavaScript will be the backbone, handling the logic of generating a random number, comparing user guesses, tracking attempts, and delivering real-time feedback to keep players engaged. Add some flourish with animations, sound effects, or a win/lose screen to enhance the user experience and create an interactive, entertaining number guessing game.
